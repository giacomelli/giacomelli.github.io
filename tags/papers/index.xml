&lt;em&gt;Abstract: This thesis describes the process of developing an interactive tool for visualization of the process of solving selected optimization problems using genetic algorithms. The theoretical part provides an introduction to the evolutionary algorithms, more specifically then focuses on genetic algorithms. This part also lists typical optimization problems that are commonly solved using genetic algorithms. The practical part describes all the important steps in creating new functional software. This includes the comparison of existing solutions, analysis of possibly suitable technologies and libraries, and software documentation. The implementation of the application, using the Blazor WebAssembly framework, is also described in this part. The interactive tool provides the visualizations of three typical optimization problems and the problem of 2D bitmap image generation. At the end, the thesis lists the techniques used for testing and documentation of the application. The final result of this thesis is a functional interactive web application.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dspace.cvut.cz/handle/10467/109406&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Abstract: Steel latticed towers are widely used as supports to conductors on transmission lines. On such projects, it is usual to use the same structural solution repeatedly along the line, what allows to achieve significant cost reduction due to structure’s design optimization. This work proposes the development of an optimization methodology based on the Genetic Algorithms concept to reduce self-supporting tower’s self-weight through the variation of its body base and top dimensions. To execute the algorithm, it was necessary to implement a system composed of modules for geometric parameterization, determination of loads, structural analysis, and sizing accordingly to ASCE 10-15. A 25-bar truss benchmark was optimized, and the results showed that the proposed methodology is effective. Besides, the performance of the methodology to optimize a self-supporting 525 kV cat-face tower was evaluated. The comparison of the results with the project of an equivalent tower which is in operation in Brazil proved the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for self-supporting towers optimization.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://repositorio.ufmg.br/handle/1843/47381&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Abstract: This work explores artificial intelligence for the game Unstable Unicorns. This game started on Kickstarter and over the years, the game creators released several expansions. This work aims to implement a game simulator for this game, analyze the game, and design the artificial intelligence for this game. First, we will analyze the game rules, game mechanics, and artificial intelligence in similar games. We implemented the game simulator as close as possible to the original rules. Afterward, we developed three different artificial intelligence algorithms. These are rule-based agents, Monte Carlo agents and evolutionary agents. Finally, we ran the experiments and comparison tests with the implemented agents. The best-performing agent is the evolutionary agent. It is quick with the best win rate.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://dspace.cuni.cz/bitstream/handle/20.500.11956/183069/130360435.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Abstract: This thesis is describing the development of a framework for graphic user interface testing with usage of Soft Computing algorithms. Development is divided into four phases. The first phase is acquaintance with existing GUI testing frameworks and their analysis. The second phase is about choosing appropriate technologies for development, appropriate algorithms and implementation design. Then there is the framework implementation phase itself and last phase with the testing, result evaluation and improvements proposal.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://theses.cz/id/fn6jrd/24813.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Abstract: Increasing the efficiency and reducing the cost of developing microwave integrated circuits (ICs) determines the trend in the development of software modules for automated synthesis of circuit and topological solutions. The article presents the results of the development of a methodology and algorithm that allow for automated synthesis of circuit solutions for integrated microwave amplifiers with distributed amplification (MW URA) based on
set of requirements for its linear characteristics. A feature of the proposed technique is the use of models of active and passive elements for the selected manufacturing technology of microwave ICs. it allows directly in the process of synthesis to obtain circuit solutions of microwave URU suitable for implementation
in a given technological process. The work of the presented CAD technique integrated microwave URU is demonstrated on the example of the development of a pre-amplification cascade for buffer amplifier for the frequency range from 20 to 30 GHz based on 0.25 μm GaAs pHEMT of the technological process of the domestic foundry.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://scholar.archive.org/work/qp6k4sgorbanjer34zqfbjl7nq/access/wayback/https://vre.instel.ru/jour/article/download/1371/1102&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;br /&gt; &lt;em&gt;Abstract: One of the biggest problems of call center employees is fair customer distribution. Every
employee wants to deal equally with customers with similar characteristics and to distribute premiums equally. Because of the large number of parameter and input data for this problem, the search space is large. Therefore, the problem is a complex, in other words NP – hard problem. Genetic Algorithm, which is an heuristical search method, is preferred in order to provide an effective solution to such problems where the solution space is very large. Within
the scope of the study, an application was developed with the help of GeneticSharp library in C# programming language, which can assign fair customers to call center employees by using the Genetic Algorithm method, and the most appropriate solution was sought. It has been determined that the genetic algorithm can provide an effective solution to the assignment problems.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://motto.tc/gorseller/files/kitaplar/icada2021.pdf&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Abstract: The new generation of steelworks shaped by Industry 4.0 are digitized, networked, flexible and adaptable. Production processes use distributed information and communication structures, are more autonomous and capable to react to dynamic evolutions of the environment. Cyber-physical systems are a fundamental component of Industry 4.0 and enable new generation of smart processes. This paper presents a modular architecture approach for the design of cyber-physical steel production processes. The approach is tested within a production facility for long products such as rails or tubes taking into account the main peculiarities of the sector. The use of an industrial-agent-based solution for enabling intelligent capabilities and interactions among cyber-physical modules is investigated and adopted. Experimental results highlight the industrial applicability of the adopted implementation scheme combining agent-based technology with the proper connection between models, communication and optimisation methods.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2405896322001719&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Abstract: Part orientation and support structures are crucial to the quality of metal parts by laser powder bed fusion. Computer-aided solutions for part orientation can be used to support users during the process preparation. In this study, an original computer-aided approach to prepare parts for laser powder bed fusion was formulated and implemented. The proposed method consists of multi-objective optimisation of part orientation and a novel strategy for the simultaneous design of support structures. The automated part orientation optimisation considers both global and local objectives defined by the user. For this purpose, penalty functions measuring the building time, support volume, part distortion, surface roughness and supports contact points are adopted. Unlike in existing methods, the user has the opportunity to define the importance of these aspects in different regions of the part. Such functions are then optimised through a genetic algorithm. The proposed approach was applied to a real product imposing three different sets of objectives. The tested case studies were solved in less than 10 min, providing solutions that satisfied the imposed aims and constraints. Specifically, the results demonstrated that the orientation optimisation can reduce the building time by 68.1% or the material consumption by 66.8%, depending on user requirements. It was also shown how the proposed method can be used to minimise the surface and dimensional error of manufactured parts. The proposed approach allows to manually define the specific design requirements and translate them in terms of manufacturing decisions. This contributes to establishing a fruitful interaction between the user and the developed software during the process design.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12008-022-00856-7&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Abstract: A complete approach for the search of top-quality six-bar linkages based on four-bar linkages generating coupler curves with circular regions has been developed. The approach includes a robust algorithm to search for high-accuracy circular regions in coupler curves and a fitness function able to evaluate the quality of the resulting linkage. The approach is used to explore the design space in order to search for optimal dwell linkages and to identify the types of linkages that provide the best dwells according to the established criteria. Then, the global optimum is searched by means of an evolutionary algorithm. The results demonstrate the efficiency and versatility of the approach, that can be customized for specific applications, and the existence of a high number of six-bar linkages with long output dwells. A highly probable global optimum is identified.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0094114X22002282&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;genetic-wfc-extending-wave-function-collapse-with-genetic-search&quot;&gt;Genetic-WFC: Extending Wave Function Collapse With Genetic Search&lt;/h1&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Abstract: This paper presents Genetic-WFC, a procedural level generation algorithm that mixes genetic optimization with Wave Function Collapse, a local adjacency constraints propagation algorithm. We use a synthetic player to evaluate the novelty, safety and complexity of the generated levels. Novelty is maximized when the synthetic player goes on tiles not visited for a long time, safety is related to how far it can see, and complexity evaluates the variability of the surrounding tiles. WFC extracts constraints from example levels, and allows us to perform the genetic search on levels with few local asset placement errors, while using as little level design rules as possible. We show that we are able to rely on WFC while optimizing the results, first by influencing WFC asset selection and then by re-encoding the chosen modules back to our genotype, in order to optimize crossover. We compare the fitness curves and best maps of our method with other approaches. We then visually explore the kind of levels we are able to generate by sampling different values of safety and complexity, giving a glimpse of the variability that our approach is able to reach.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9836972&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;em&gt;Abstract: The demand for new deconstruction and demolition approaches is escalating as structures built in 20th century development booms approach their end of life. Rehabilitation and careful deconstruction approaches are increasingly economically and environmentally motivating. For example, in Ontario, Canada multi-decade efforts to decommission nuclear power plants are challenging teams of engineers, researchers, venders, and laborers. In these hazardous scenarios, classical heavy demolition approaches are not an option, and the asset owners find that the costly development of novel workflows and technologies to plan and undergo these deconstruction operations is the only option. These trends present construction researchers with an opportunity to develop technologies and processes to achieve
deconstruction project goals with improved efficiency, certainty, and safety. This paper presents a modular framework for remote human-robot collaboration for waste management in decommissioning and demolition. The proposed framework includes robotic platform reality data capture, scan processing (e.g., segmentation, surface estimation, and recognition), gamified waste packing in virtual reality (VR), and packing plan execution. A comprehensive review of state-of-the-art technologies of each module is explored from the standpoint of applicability to deconstruction and demolition. Then, an autonomous robotic platform for reality data capture is presented. A reconfigurable semi-automated VR platform for waste packing optimization is presented as an example of this process workflow in the context of remote deconstruction and demolition. Finally, the ideas of robotic packing plan execution are discussed as future work.&lt;/em&gt; (&lt;a href=&quot;https://conferences.lib.unb.ca/index.php/tcrc/article/view/616&quot;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;
